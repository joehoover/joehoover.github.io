## Professional Profile

I help teams and organizations research, develop, and deploy AI systems. I've founded and lead high-performing NLP teams in both early-startup and enterprise contexts. As a leader and individual contributor, I've shipped a wide range of ML systems, with a primary focus on putting large language models in production. I thrive under pressure and am driven by a love for building innovative technology that solves hard problems.

I'm currently looking for my next big project! I'm primarily interested in leadership roles on technical NLP/ML/LLM teams, but I'd also consider Sr+ IC roles on the right team. 

## Blog

I'm launching a blog focused on putting LLMs in production! I've worked on many aspects of this process and I continue to be surprised by how hard it is, particularly around the edges of each phase. There are a proliferation of tools that ease parts of the process, but it remains difficult to stitch everything together. The blog is a gift to my future-self (and others, if they find some use in it) that aims to treat some of the primary pain points that we encounter when prototyping, productionizing, and deploying ML systems that rely on LLMs. I'm going to focus on deep-dives with comprehensive code and reproducible repositories that can be used as patterns for solutions to common problems. 

## Consulting and Advisement

I consult on architecture, AI strategy, and end-to-end projects. If you're interested in working together, please feel free to get in touch!
