I've found myself too comfortable, lately. And yet, not comfortable at all. 

Working at a growing startup; trying to keep up with ML; raising a 2 y/o human; attempting to be a semi-functional human with a body and mind and social fabric that won't disassemble sooner than I'd like...has left me with little time for exploration.

This is, of course, ironic because exploration&ndash;the pursuit of curiosity&ndash;is a cornerstone of human flourishing. If you don't explore, you're stuck, whether you know it or not.

So, instead of frittering away the small bits of time I occasionally have at hand, I've decided to start a blog. As a forcing function, an excuse, a promise, a goal. A reminder to explore and an inverse log of stasis.

Hard to say what I'll blog about as that would somewhat defeat the point. However, I _am_ quite interested in language models, performance optimization, and work that elides the boundary between language models and the softer sides of life, such as narratives, social systems, and human psychology.
