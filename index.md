I am a computational social psychologist and postdoctoral fellow in the Kellogg Department of Management and Organizations 
at Northwestern University. 

I rely on state-of-the-art computational methods and artificial intelligence to study the psychological underpinnings of intergroup conflict and violence, 
with a specific focus on the role that morality plays in these phenomena. My research focuses on questions such as:

* [Why do people engage in acts of hate](papers/preprint_hoover_bound_in_hatred.pdf)?
* [Can we predict real-world violent protest from social media dynamics](hoover_protest_violence.pdf)?

I also directly engage with fundamental methodological issues, 
such as measuring psychological constructs in natural language and deriving reliable 
estimates from biased and non-representative 
data. 

For example, working with [YourMorals.org](http://yourmorals.org), 
I've developed population adjusted estimates of the county-level distribution of moral values 
in the United States. For an interactive visualization of this work, you can vist
