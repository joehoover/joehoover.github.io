I work primarily in the [Computational Social Science Lab](http://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/cssl) and [Virtues Ideology and Morality Lab](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~jessegra/people.html) with [Morteza Dehghani](http://morteza-dehghani.net/) and [Jesse Graham](https://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1032745).

I rely on statistical models, machine learning, and natural language processing to investigate social behavior, with a special focus on using linguistic measurements of psychological constructs to predict real-world outcomes. 

I'm currently updating this entire site. Please check back soon!
