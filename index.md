I am a Ph.D. student in Psychology at the University of Southern California, where I work with [Morteza Dehghani](http://morteza-dehghani.net/) and [Jesse Graham](https://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1032745) in the [Computational Social Science](http://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/cssl) and [Virtues Ideology and Morality](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~jessegra/people.html) labs. 

I rely on statistical modeling, machine learning, natural language processing, and conventional experimental paradigms to investigate social behavior. I am most interested in developing and appylying computational methods for measuring psychologically relevant constructs in natural language and integrating these measurements into statistical models of real-world outcomes.
