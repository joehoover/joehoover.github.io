I am a Social Psychology PhD student at the University of Southern California, where I work primarily with [Morteza Dehghani](http://morteza-dehghani.net/) and [Jesse Graham](https://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1032745) in the [Computational Social Science](http://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/cssl) and the [Virtues Ideology and Morality](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~jessegra/people.html) labs. 

My research falls at the intersection of social psychology, statistics, and computer science.
