The link below leads to RSVis, an *in development* shiny dashboard for visualizing surface analysis components. 

[RSVis](https://joe-hoover.shinyapps.io/RSVis/)


Currently, the dashboard allows you to set the true effects for the five regression coefficients (left panel) that constitute a Surface Analysis regression and then plot the three-dimensional surface representing the defined function (center panel). The dashboard also calculates the surface components a1 through a4 that are used for evaluating PE fit effects. 

To use the dashboard, either select a preset model from the coefficient presets drop-down or set the coefficients yourself. Then click the *Plot Surface* button to render the corresponding surface plot. 

In the future, as the interface indicates, the dashboard will also support plotting points and data simulation.
